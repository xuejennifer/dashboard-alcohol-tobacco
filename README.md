Longitudinal substance preferences: Alcohol and Tobacco in the U.S.
=====================

American healthcare institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have meticulous datasets for alcohol and tobacco consumption in the United States. Yet, there are few analyses that look at consumption of these substances side-by-side over time. Through this project, we investigated the longitudinal effects and patterns of alcohol and tobacco consumption in the U.S. across time at national, regional, and state levels.
